# Final-Game for 4410
This is a game inspired by the exercise and the game flappy bird which was a famous game many years ago. The way the game works is that you will have to get as many points as possible by jumping on the white lines and avoiding the birds. The white lines and the birds will fly in the same direction and the hardest thing is to avoid the birds when you are trying to jump on the white lines.
